# SimplyPack Prototype ðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š - HackRX2023 Submission

`SimplyPack` aims to make the production of in-store blister packs more efficient for the pharmacy staff and safer for the patients. Our software streamlines the blister packaging process into a few simple steps, ultimately reducing the possibility for error and allowing for a smoother workflow in the pharmacy.

## Features
- Able to view each patient profile awaiting blister-packs 
- - `Medication` image will pop up, allowing pharmacy staff to know if they picked the correct medicine
- Medication image will move to correct spot on grid - pharmacy staff will know what the finished blister-pack should look like 
- Helps pharmacists during verification process
- ```[Not implemented in prototype ðŸš§]``` Must scan barcode of each bottle / box - if wrong medication selected, system will not let you continue 
- ```[Not implemented in prototype ðŸš§]``` Ability to **flag a patient profile** if prescriber has made any changes to the blister-pack 
- ```[Not implemented in prototype ðŸš§]``` **Auth mechanisms** to ensure patient data is accessed and updated safely
- ```[Not implemented in prototype ðŸš§]``` **Timer feature** - can estimate average time to make a blister-pack
